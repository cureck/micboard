# OAuth Credentials UI Implementation âœ…

## What I've Added

### 1. **OAuth Credentials Input Form**
- Added a clean card interface at the top of the integrations page
- Input fields for both Planning Center and Google Drive OAuth credentials
- Client ID and Client Secret fields (Client Secret is password-protected)
- "Save OAuth Credentials" button with success/error feedback

### 2. **Backend Support**
- New `/api/oauth-credentials` endpoint to save credentials
- Credentials stored in both environment variables (for current session) and config file (for persistence)
- Updated OAuth modules to load credentials dynamically from config when environment variables aren't available

### 3. **Frontend Integration**
- Credentials are loaded from localStorage when the page loads
- Saved credentials persist across browser sessions
- Clear validation and error handling
- Success/error status messages

## How to Use

### Step 1: Get OAuth Credentials
1. **Planning Center**: Go to https://api.planningcenteronline.com/oauth/applications
2. **Google Drive**: Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/

### Step 2: Enter Credentials in UI
1. Open Micboard â†’ Menu â†’ Integrations
2. Enter your OAuth credentials in the form at the top
3. Click "Save OAuth Credentials"
4. You'll see a success message

### Step 3: Authorize Services
1. After saving credentials, click "Authorize Planning Center" or "Authorize Google Drive"
2. Complete the OAuth flow in the popup window
3. Configure your integration settings
